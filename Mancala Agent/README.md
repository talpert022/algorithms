# MancalaAgent
An agent that plays a game of Mancala against a computer. This agent uses a minimax search with alpha beta pruining to reduce search time. The project gave the constraint of having the player move take less than 0.5 seconds, and through initial testing  creating and searching a game tree with a depth of 8 usually results in a move that takes between 0.2 and 0.4 seconds.

Calling the main method in the Mancala.java file will run the game between my agent (MancalaImp.java) and a random agent (RandomAgent.java)
